To set up a local copy of the git repository cd to where you want it and type:

git clone https://github.com/CTCH-HS1511-TUTE/HS1511-PROJECT.git


This code will add/stage the changes you have made, you need to do this before you commit:

git add –all 


This will commit a change to your local copy but not the remote copy on GitHub:

git commit -m “YOUR MESSAGE HERE”


This will push your changes to the remote copy on git:

git push


If you need to revert back to the remote copy, commit your changes then type this:

git pull


This shows you all the changes you have made:

git status

If you want to list all the git commands just type: 
git
